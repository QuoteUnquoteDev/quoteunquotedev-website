Welcome to this site.
Since it is actually under construction, I am going to leave a small FAQ in the meantime

# FAQ

### What is this page?
This website is meant for me to share whatever I learn and to use as a mix of blog and devlog.

### Who are you?
I am a latin american guy that has decided to become a game developer. I have loved games and the stories they tell my entire life.  My actual, professional, background is in healthcare.

### Why game development?
I started making games like 20 years ago. My dad gave me access to a computer and to Game Maker, by Mark Overmars, way back then. I made tons and tons of little experiments, mainly shoot em ups, top down shooters and platformers. That got me hooked. Despite everything, I still have a genuine wish to craft experiences that captivate people's attention and transport them, even for a moment, to a completely different world.

### Have you ever released anything?
Nope. I have made submissions to a couple of game jams and that's it for my game dev achievements. My goal is to actually release a bite sized, relatively polished, experience before the end of 2025.

### What tools do you use?
I used the Unity game engine for a couple years but I am currently learning Godot. I use Blender for 3D modeling, Aseprite and Krita for textures and everything art related, FLStudio and Audacity for sound related stuff (although, if I'm honest, audio is my greatest weakness). My PC currently runs on Arch Linux.

### Favorite game genre?
Horror. I am deathly afraid horror games, actually. I am scaredy and jumpy as all heck. But I absolutely love scary games, they truly fascinate me. Not the ones that have loads of jumpscares, though, the ones that play with your mind and make you scare yourself.

### Favorite games?
My favorite game of all time is Nier: Automata. Other games I really like are Silent Hill, Signalis, Cyberpunk 2077 and Baroque.
